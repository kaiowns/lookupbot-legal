**Last Updated:** August 8, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what information **LookupBot** collects, how it is stored, and how it is used.

## 1. Data Collection
LookupBot does **not** collect any personal information about you.

## 2. How Data is Stored
- Data is stored locally within LookupBotâ€™s source files in **JSON** format.
- No external databases or third-party services are used.

## 3. Data Retention
- Join date data is stored indefinitely.
- Data will only be removed if LookupBot is permanently discontinued.

## 4. Data Usage
- Stored join dates are used exclusively for the `!lookup` command or similar commands that retrieve join date information.
- No data is shared or sold to third parties.

## 5. Security
While we do our best to keep stored data safe, we cannot guarantee complete security due to the nature of online services.

## 6. Contact
